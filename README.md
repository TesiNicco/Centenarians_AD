# Centenarians_AD
Script to perform association analysis and downstream analysis of SNP associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a cohort of cognitively healthy centenarians. This script accompanies the publication entitled `Cognitively Healthy Centenarians are gentically protectected against Alzheimer's Disease (AD)`.

# Input files
1. AD snps from Bellenguez et al., 2022: clinical AD vs. healthy controls summary statistics of significant AD snps
2. AD snps from Bellenguez et al., 2022: clinical AD + proxy AD vs. healthy controls summary statistics of significant AD snps
3. Path to where genotype data is stored 
4. Phenotype information about the included samples

# Output files
1. Single-variant association statistics, for each SNP, in AD cases vs. healthy controls and AD cases vs. centenarians
2. Polygenic Risk Score for each individual
3. Association statistics of the Polygenic Risk Score
4. Power analysis summary
5. Figures and Tables
